description: List OpenSpec proposals and their status
model: haiku

First, check if `openspec/` directory exists. If not, respond: "This project doesn't have OpenSpec set up."

If OpenSpec is present, run `openspec list` to display all active changes and their progress.

<!--
TEST CASES:
- `/list` in project with openspec/ → runs openspec list, shows proposals
- `/list` in project without openspec/ → politely explains OpenSpec not set up
-->
