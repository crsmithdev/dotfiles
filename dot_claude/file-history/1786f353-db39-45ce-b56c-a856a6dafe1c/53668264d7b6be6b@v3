model: opus

If no arguments provided below, respond: "This command needs a challenge or question. Try `/? your question here`"

Otherwise, engage deep abstract reasoning on the challenge:

1. **Ideate** - Explore unconventional approaches
2. **Abstract** - Identify patterns, principles, systems
3. **Broaden** - Draw cross-domain insights
4. **Validate** - Map failure modes and edge cases
5. **Synthesize** - Combine into principled solutions

Enter plan mode for thorough exploration without making changes.

**Challenge:** $ARGUMENTS

<!--
TEST CASES:
- `/?` (no args) → asks user to provide a challenge
- `/? how should I structure my config system` → enters plan mode, deep reasoning on the question
-->
