description: Black box - save context for next session

**Black box - save context across sessions**

This command saves or resumes context between Claude sessions.

File: `/tmp/claude-black-box.txt`

Modes:
- **Save mode**: `/bb <message>` or `/bb ^` - write to file for next session
- **Resume mode**: `/bb !` - read file and continue, delete file after reading
- **Auto-cleanup**: File auto-deletes on next startup if never resumed

To implement:
1. If args contain `!` → Read the file, delete it, then continue based on content
2. If args contain `^` → Save last request/response to file
3. Otherwise → Save the message to file
